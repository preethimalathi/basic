Method Overriding
======================

- When a base class method is no suitable to the derived class. In the derived class we need to rewrite that method. This process is called method overriding.

//Generalized class|Super class
public class Shape 
{
	double dim1,dim2;
	
	public Shape(double dim1,double dim2)
	{
		this.dim1=dim1;
		this.dim2=dim2;
	}
	
	public double area()
	{
		return 0.0;
	}
	
}


public class Rectangle extends Shape 
{
	public Rectangle(double dim1,double dim2)
	{
		super(dim1,dim2);
	}
	
	//override
	public double area()
	{
		return dim1*dim2;
	}
}


public class ShapeMain 
{
	public static void main(String arg[])
	{
		Rectangle rectangle=new Rectangle(10,20);
		
		System.out.println("Area of Rectangle:"+rectangle.area());
	}
}


Certain rules which need to follow when we do method overrding
=================================================

1. Method name should be same 

2. Parameter level should be same

3. Access Specifier level should be same or higher.
