Java 
==============

- Java is a system comprises of three things.

1. Java Language		
	
	- In this we are discussing about the syntax of the java language , keywords and 	certain lexical issues.

2. Java Envirnoment 

	- Here we are going to discuss about the the architecture of java and the 	execution process of java.

3. Java API(Application Programming Interface)

	- The packages which are provided by java by which we create different 	applications.

	Ex : java.lang  - This is the basic and vital package which every program 			requires.

	java.util : - This is the utility package which is used for certain applications like
	Collection , Date etc.

	java.sql : - This package is used for connecting to the database.

	java.net :- This package is used for network related programs


Java Edition
=============

There are three editions which are available

1. Java Standard Edition 	: Java SE 

	- Basic console based program to develop.

	- Package : java.lang , java.net , java.util etc

2. Java Enterprise Edition 	: Java EE

	- To develop the web based or distributed level application.

	- Some of the Web component we develop : Servlet & JSP(Java Server Pages)

	- Business Component : EJB (Enterprise Java Bean)

3. Java Micro Edition	: Java ME

	- To develop the application in handheld devices.

	- Application developed for Mobile , TV set box

Java Version
================

Jdk 1.1

Jdk 1.2

Jdk 1.3

Jdk 1.4

Jdk 1.5 - Tiger  - Generic 

Jdk 1.6

Jdk 1.7 - String in Switch , Try with Resources , New NIO 

Jdk 1.8  - Lambda , Predicates , Stream API


Java Language
================

Characterset 
=============
- A - Z , a-z , 0-9 , Some special characters

Identifier
==============

- Identifiers are going to identify the programming elements  like variables , class , Interfaces , methods etc.

- Certin rules we need to follw when we write identifier

	1. It should start with alphbet not with digits or special characters except _(underscore).
	2. It can be followed by the digits 

	3. It should not contain any embedded space and any special characters

	4. It should not be the same name as that of keywords of java.


	Valid Identifiers	: num1 , student_name , student_id , _number1

	Invalid Identifiers 	: student name, 1num , float ,volatile, student$id

Keywords
============

- These are special pupose words which are used by the java. The following are the keywords which are used for some special purposes


1. Data Type :  byte , short , int , long , float ,double , char , boolean

2. Access Specifier : public , private , protected.

3. Acess Modifiers : static , volatile , final , abstract , synchronized , native

4. Define : class , interface 

5. Operator : instanceof 

6. Other : void  , strictfp 

Sample Program in java
======================

class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String arg[])
	{
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

- Any java program should start with class as it is an object oriented programming.

- Class Name should have the file name it mean if the class name is HelloWorld the file  name should be HelloWorld.java

- Class name should be written in true case it means each words first letter will be capital.

- main() is the first function from which the program starts.

- String arg[] which is the parameters to the main method also called as command line argument.

- System.out.println() - Is the statement to print in console prompt

	System - Class , out - PrintStream object , println- method to print in console.



Executing the Java Program
============================

To compile the java file

javac Filename.java

c:\S180233>javac HelloWorl.java 

Note : After compilation the bytecode file or the class file will be generated which can be run any jvm.

To interpret the class File

java Filename

c:\S180233>java HelloWorld


DataType
=================

- These are going to specify the typeof data the variable will hold.

1.Integer		Memory

A. byte		-1 * 8		- 2^7   to  2^7-1

B. short		-2 * 16		- 2^15 to 2^15-1

C. int		-4

D. long		-8

2.Floating

A. float		-4

B. double		-8

3.Character

A. char		-2

4. Boolean

A. boolean	-1
